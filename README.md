> This is the server application for the first _quantum of utility_. Soon to evolve into a _quanta of utility_ to make it possible for anyone to achieve their **ultimate genetically optimal body**.

> Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things - and saying yes to ONE Thing. -- Moe & Steve üí°

This project is mostly an attempt to put into practice all the knowledge gathered on [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html){:target="\_blank"} and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID){:target="\_blank"} to create a software that can be extended easily in the long term. The project was abandoned after realizing that the world doesn't need another fitness app; it needs a robot instead.

## How to Run & Test

To run the server use `./scripts/run_server.sh`. To run the tests use `./scripts/run_tests.sh`.
